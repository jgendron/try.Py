# try.Py - Learn Python
Welcome to the code repository for the try.Py - Learn Python Meetup. It provides anyone interested in programming with a foundational and hands-on experience. This Meetup is inspired by two freely available sources to learn Python:

* [The Google Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) (includes video lectures)
* [Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
 
Both resources provide instruction and example code. They are excellent resources to help you learn Python.

## Why try.Py?
With so many resources available, why a [try.Py - Learn Python Meetup?](http://www.meetup.com/tryPy-Learn-Python/)

We are social beings and sometimes learning is best in person. This co-op is dedicated to creating an environment where you can learn at your own pace in a live setting.  Whether you are best described as _know programming_ or _no programming_, we are here to get you started..._from square one_/. We're not just for those who want to code as a career - we invite managers and executives interested in learning the basics of programming and how it applies to areas like data science, genetics, robotics, databases, and more.

## What do you do?
Learn the five essentials of programming. Bring your laptop and a learning attitude and you'll be programming in no time.

* Functions and Logic and Variables, oh my!
* Strings and Things
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Git going and Share your Creations

## What can I expect?

Come and join a session. Keep attending until you feel comfortable with the five essentials. You can work on them in any order. Then choose your own adventure:

* __User Groups:__ We can help you find a user group that meets your interests - web dev, data science, robotics...
* __Teach Others:__ You can really firm up your knowledge by joining the other co-op members and teaching others what you have learned

In the meantime, come check out our [Wiki Page](https://github.com/jgendron/try.Py/wiki) with reflections on this Co-op.
